This is the server-side part of the project, built mostly with Python.

Here, you can access the Jupyter-developed machine learning model within `research/Modeling.ipynb` as well as the pickled binary file representation of the saved classifier in `saved_models/full_pipeline.pkl`. 

Additionally, you can access the backend configuration and runtime files via `app.py` and `services.py`. 

To activate the backend server, execute the command `python app.py` from the command line.
